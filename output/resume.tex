\subsection[experience]{Experience}

{\bf Teaching and tutoring:}

Assisting my PhD advisor at Programming II course (Winter Semester of
2017 and 2018). Main responsibilities are giving tutorial and Lab
sessions, guiding students on team assignments and preparing
presentations. Secondary, providing lectures and tutorial sessions for
BootCamp (Oct. 2017 - May 2018)

\subsection[technical-experience]{Technical Experience}

\startdescription{My Cool Side Project}
  For items which don't have a clear time ordering, a definition list
  can be used to have named items.

  \startitemize[packed]
  \item
    These items can also contain lists, but you need to mind the
    indentation levels in the markdown source.
  \item
    Second item.
  \stopitemize
\stopdescription

\startdescription{Open Source}
  List open source contributions here, perhaps placing emphasis on the
  project names, for example the {\bf Linux Kernel}, where you
  implemented multithreading over a long weekend, or {\bf node.js} (with
  \useURL[url1][http://nodejs.org][][link]\from[url1]) which was
  actually totally your idea\ldots{}
\stopdescription

\startdescription{Programming Languages}
  {\bf first-lang:} Here, we have an itemization, where we only want to
  add descriptions to the first few items, but still want to mention
  some others together at the end. A format that works well here is a
  description list where the first few items have their first word
  emphasized, and the last item contains the final few emphasized terms.
  Notice the reasonably nice page break in the pdf version, which
  wouldn't happen if we generated the pdf via html.

  {\bf second-lang:} Description of your experience with second-lang,
  perhaps again including a
  \useURL[url2][https://github.com/githubuser/superlongprojectname][][link]\from[url2],
  this time placing the url reference elsewhere in the document to
  reduce clutter (see source file).

  {\bf obscure-but-impressive-lang:} We both know this one's pushing it.

  Basic knowledge of {\bf C}, {\bf x86 assembly}, {\bf forth},
  {\bf Common Lisp}
